marvel-get-calls
================

A collection of simple GET calls for the Marvel API in varying languages. I started this because I often find no examples or a whole library to call. Nothing inbetween. So here are example calls.

These will all be GETs using cURL

You will need a Marvel Developers account to get API and Private Keys

You will need to set your domain as a authorized referrer in your Marvel Developers account

All time stamping is simply set to 1

The GET is for characters?name=Spider-Man but you can adjust this as you see fit.

Use your keys and parameters and time stamps as you like.
